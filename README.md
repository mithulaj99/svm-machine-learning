# svm-machine-learning
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification Project
# Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project implemented in Python using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The objective is to preprocess data, train an SVM model, and evaluate its performance using standard metrics.

 Technologies Used

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib / Seaborn

 📂 Project Structure
 ├── svm.ipynb          # Jupyter Notebook with full implementation
├── dataset.csv        # Dataset used (if applicable)
├── README.md          # Project documentation

# ⚙️ Workflow

1.Data loading and exploration

2.Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)

3.Train-test split

4.SVM model training

5.Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

# 📊 Model Used

- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Kernel: Linear / RBF (as used in the notebook)

- Library: scikit-learn

# ✅ Results

The model achieves reliable classification performance after proper preprocessing and feature scaling. Evaluation metrics are included in the notebook.
